[Newtonian gravity][newton-gravity] is way cool. So, cool that I will show you how you can make your own HTML5
canvas game simulating gravity. Don't worry it won't be hard. I will write down every step
which is needed for our game.

{% include video.html video="miniksp.webm" width="640" loop="true" %}

> technology, but the canvas might still not work everywhere as expected (_blame IE_).

{% highlight js %}
function gravitateTo(planet, obj) {
  var r   = planet.pos.distanceTo(obj.pos),
      f   = (planet.mass*obj.mass)/(r*r),
      phi = obj.pos.angleTo(planet.pos);

  obj.gravity.setPolar(phi, f);
  return gravity;
}

## Vector basics
The game that we will write, needs a way to represent forces: velocity, acceleration and etc.
The tool that we need is [vectors][vector].

I won't really get into the vector basics, you must already be familiar with the easy stuff:

+ vector addition (therefore substitution)
* multiplication (and division)
* scaling (multipling a vector with a scalar number)

We will need some more than that, but this is the basics.
